This pattern shows a Form with inputs tailored to filtering Press Articles

@see [@organisms/by-author/press-listing](https://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/patternlab/?p=organisms-press-filters&view=c)

*Note:* This version makes press-filter topic optional as that is not rendered in the news tab of the search application. This change needs to be ported back into mayflower.
