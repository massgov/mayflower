### Description
The RichText component is a wrapper component that renders raw HTML as React components, using the [react-html-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-html-parser) library. It is to avoid the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. The RichText component can render raw HTML nodes passed as `children`, or an HTML string passed via prop `rawHtml`. 

### Status
* Major change since v10.0.0
