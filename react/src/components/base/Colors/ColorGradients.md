## Mayflower Color Gradient Variants

Gradients are generated for each Mayflower brand color to provide additional options for data visualization usage. The "Light" and "Dark" spectrums are programmatically generated using functions `tint` and `shade` for consistency.

### Use Tint to Generate Light Gradient Variants
`tint` takes in a `$color` and mixes it with color white. It also takes in a percentage to define the percentage of `$color` in the mix.

### Use Dark to Generate Light Gradient Variants
`shade` takes in a `$color` and mixes it with color black. It also takes in a percentage to define the percentage of `$color` in the mix.

### Use the Color Story to Generate Hex Values
