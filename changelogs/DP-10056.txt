___DESCRIPTION___
Changed
Major
- (Patternlab) DP-10056: Mayflower Patternlab has an updated build process that includes the following changes:
    * Gulp Patternlab tasks now run `dist:build` automatically.  The `dist` folder contains the fully compiled Mayflower Artifacts, and can be placed anywhere on your system, not just inside the mayflower repository.
    * Patternlab deployment tasks have been moved out of gulp and into the CircleCI configuration to simplify our Gulp tasks.
    * The `massgov/mayflower-artifacts` Composer package has been given a `type` of `drupal-library` so it is installable to a specific location on the filesystem.
- (Patternlab, React) DP-10056: Mayflower React and Mayflower Patternlab now manage the version number in their respective `package.json` files independently.  We no longer need to bump package version numbers manually on release - simply cut the tag.
- (NPM Artifact): The @massds/mayflower NPM repo has been restructured to match the `massgov/mayflower-artifacts` composer package..


___POST DEPLOY STEPS___
1. [This PR](https://github.com/massgov/mass/pull/2661) needs to go into the mass.gov codebase at the same time this release is pulled in.
2. Notify the Mayflower React team that the `@massds/mayflower` package restructuring is being released.
