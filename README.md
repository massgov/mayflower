## Monorepo Package Management
This monorepo is managed using [Rush](https://rushjs.io/) and [PNPM](https://pnpm.js.org/).
#### Getting Started on Development
To get started, install rush globally by running the following command:

```
npm install -g @microsoft/rush
```

Once installed, run `rush install`. This will install pnpm and each package's dependencies on disk and symlink together all local packages that depend on one another.

To start developing mayflower react:
- `rush start:react`

To start developing mayflower patternlab:
- `rush start:patternlab`

To start developing mayflower site:
- `cd packages/react && rushx build` (build local @massds/mayflower-react)
- `rush start:site`

#### Monorepo Structure
All uses of `npm` or `yarn` have been replaced by `rushx`. `rushx` uses `pnpm run` behind the scenes to execute scripts within a package. For the moment, the following are defined as packages for the mayflower monorepo:

- Mayflower Core (located under `packages/core/`)
- Mayflower Assets (located under `packages/assets/`)
- Mayflower React (located under `packages/react/`)
- Mayflower Patternlab (located under `packages/patternlab/`)
- Mayflower Homepage (located under `packages/site/`)
```

```

Each packages' dependencies from npm are installed using Rush's cli tools. When using `rush install`, rush will use `pnpm install` behind the scenes within each package's directories. Each dependency is actually installed in a directory (.pnpm) located in your home directory and hardlinked to within Rush's internal temporary store at `common/temp/`. Each dependency of a package located under `<package-name>/node_modules/` is actually a hard symlink to rush's own temporary store at `common/temp/`.

Rush configuration is stored in the root directory as `rush.json`.

Each package also no longer uses package-lock.json or yarn.lock. Instead, a single pnpm-lock.yaml file is made under `common/temp/` which is created/updated when running rush commands.

Rush also either symlinks (by default) or local installs a copy of every package that uses one another from the monorepo. An example of this is Mayflower React. Mayflower React depends on Mayflower Assets, so under Mayflower React's `node_modules/` there is a symlink that points directly to the location of Mayflower Assets on disk instead of the rush temporary store under `common/temp/`.

#### Useful Commands

- `rush install` - Use this to install dependencies for all packages.
- `rush update` - Use this after updating rush/pnpm configurations.
- `rush build` - Use this to make production builds for all packages.
- `rush add` - Use this to add a new dependency to a package.
  - To add a dependency for a package, `cd` into the specific package directory and run `rush add --package "example@^1.2.3"`

> For more rush commands, see the [rush command documentation](https://rushjs.io/pages/commands/rush_add/).

#### Other Commands
When needing to run other commands for a package (such as starting up development mode), use `rushx` instead of `npm` or `yarn` in the package directory. For example, to run development mode for react, instead of using `npm run start`, move to the `packages/react/` direction and use `rushx start`.

### Custom Commands
Custom commands for rush are defined within `common/config/rush/command-line.json`. The following custom commands exist:
- `rush start:core` - Starts storybook in development mode for Mayflower Core.
- `rush start:react` - Starts storybook in development mode for Mayflower React.
- `rush start:patternlab` - Starts patternlab in development mode for Mayflower Artifacts
- `rush start:site` - Starts gatsby in development mode for `packages/site`.

> For more information on custom commands see the [Rush custom commands documentation](https://rushjs.io/pages/maintainer/custom_commands/).

## Continuous Integration using CircleCI
By default, each push to a remote branch will trigger build and tests for React Storybook and Patternlab, deploy the Patternlab site build bundle to S3, as well as run the distribution build for the mayflower-tokens package in the [assets](/assets) folder.
For efficiency purposes, we allow CircleCI to bypass certain jobs based on the prefix of the branch name. Please only use these prefixes for the following scenarios:

| Branch name prefix  | Rule | Scenario |
|---|---|---|
| `core/`  | This will bypass Patternlab build, deploy and tests | This prefix should only be used if all your changes are in the [core](/packages/core) folder
| `react/`  | This will bypass Patternlab build, deploy and tests | This prefix should only be used if all your changes are in the [react](/packages/react) folder, and nothing in the shared [assets](/packages/assets) folder that could potentially impact the build of the Patternlab implementation  |
| `pattern/`  | This will bypass React Storybook build and tests | This prefix should only be used if all your changes are in the [patternlab](/packages/patternlab) folder, and nothing in the shared [assets](/packages/assets) folder that could potentially impact the build of the React implementation  |
| `site/`  | This will bypass all React and Patternlab and assets build, deploy and tests. |  Only use this prefix if all the changes are in the [site](/packages/site) folder. e.g. Content changes to the homepage site that won't impact React, Patternlab and shared assets. |
| `docs`  | This will bypass all React and Patternlab and assets build, deploy and tests, as well as Mayflower site build and tests. | Only use this prefix if all the changes are in the [docs](/docs) folder. e.g. Documentation changes for the repo that won't impact React, Patternlab, shared assets and the homepage static site. |
