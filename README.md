## Monorepo Package Management
This PR adds support for the creation of a monorepo using [Rush](https://rushjs.io/) and [PNPM](https://pnpm.js.org/).

#### Getting Started on Development
To install both pnpm and rush globally, run the following command:
```
npm install -g pnpm @microsoft/rush
```

Once installed, run `rush install` or `rush update`. This will install each package's dependencies on disk and symlink together all local packages that depend on one another.

#### Monorepo Structure
All uses of `npm` or `yarn` have been replaced by `pnpm` which works similarly. For the moment, the following are defined as packages for the mayflower monorepo:

- Mayflower Assets (located under `packages/assets/`)
- Mayflower React (located under `packages/react/`)
- Mayflower Artifacts (located under `packages/patternlab/styleguide/`)
- `packages/site/`

Each of the packages' dependencies from npm are installed using Rush's cli tools. To install packages initially, use the command `rush install` at either the root directory or within any of the package directories. When installing packages using `rush install`, rush will use `pnpm install` within each package's directories. Each dependency is actually installed in a directory (.pnpm) located in your home directory and symlinked to within Rush's internal temporary store at `common/temp/`. Each dependency of a package located under `<package-name>/node_modules/` is actually a symlink to rush's own temporary store at `common/temp/`.

Rush configuration is stored in the root directory as `rush.json`.

Each package also no longer uses package-lock.json or yarn.lock. Instead, a single pnpm-lock.yaml file is made under `common/temp/` which is created/updated when running rush commands.

Rush also either symlinks (by default) or local installs a copy of every package that uses one another from the monorepo. An example of this is Mayflower React. Mayflower React depends on Mayflower Assets, so under Mayflower React's `node_modules/` there is a symlink that points directly to the location of Mayflower Assets on disk instead of the rush temporary store under `common/temp/`.

#### Useful Commands

- `rush add` - Use this to add a new dependency to a package.
- `rush install` - Use this to install dependencies for all packages.
- `rush update` - Use this after updating rush/pnpm configurations.
- `rush build` - Use this to make production builds for all packages.

#### Other Commands
When needing to run other commands for a package (such as starting up development mode), use `pnpm` instead of `npm` or `yarn` in the package directory. For example, to run development mode for react, instead of using `npm run start`, move to the `packages/react/` direction and use `pnpm run start`.


## Continuous Integration using CircleCI
By default, each push to a remote branch will trigger build and tests for React Storybook and Patternlab, deploy the Patternlab site build bundle to S3, as well as run the distribution build for the mayflower-tokens package in the [assets](/assets) folder.
For efficiency purposes, we allow CircleCI to bypass certain jobs based on the prefix of the branch name. Please only use these prefixes for the following scenarios:

| Branch name prefix  | Rule | Scenario |
|---|---|---|
| `react/`  | This will bypass Patternlab build, deploy and tests | This prefix should only be used if all your changes are in the [react](/react) folder, and nothing in the shared [assets](/assets) folder that could potentially impact the build of the Patternlab implementation  |
| `pattern/`  | This will bypass React Storybook build and tests | This prefix should only be used if all your changes are in the [patternlab](/patternlab) folder, and nothing in the shared [assets](/assets) folder that could potentially impact the build of the React implementation  |
| `site/`  | This will bypass all React and Patternlab and assets build, deploy and tests. |  Only use this prefix if all the changes are in the [site](/site) folder. e.g. Content changes to the homepage site that won't impact React, Patternlab and shared assets. |
| `docs`  | This will bypass all React and Patternlab and assets build, deploy and tests, as well as Mayflower site build and tests. | Only use this prefix if all the changes are in the [docs](/docs) folder. e.g. Documentation changes for the repo and the Mayflower Gitbook that won't impact React, Patternlab, shared assets and the homepage static site. |
