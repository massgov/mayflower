## Accessibility

## Web accessibility and Mass.gov

Mass.gov is the website owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  As a government website, it is required to conform to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 and 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/).

Mayflower is a design system for the Mass.gov website. It is designed and developed to meet such web acccessibility guideline.  If you follow this system's samples, your website would be accessible by broad range of users.

As technology evolves, some methods to meet the guideline could get outdated. We will update outdated ones though our periodical accessibility testing.

We value web accessibility, and consider it is important to promote it to anybody who own and work on websites. Here, you'll find resources for web accessibility from basic concepts to technical approaches.

## What is web accessibility?

Web accessibility means **making your website available to as many people as possible**.

It’s a combination of common sense, empathy and understanding. 

Source: [WUHCAG](https://www.wuhcag.com/what-is-web-accessibility/)

Web accessibility refers to the **inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to websites, by people with disabilities**.

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility)

Web accessibility consists of two parts:

- phylosophy &mdash; equivalent user experience
- process &mdash; techniques + code (what we build on line)

They both are equally important to achieve the goal of creating an accessible website.

## Why web accessibility matters

At its core, the Web is about people being able to find and access information. Increasingly, access to online information is essential to our daily lives.  Benefits from the Web are supposed to be avaiable to anybody.  There shouldn't be any exception to any of us. 

When it’s broken down, the word accessibility is the “ability” to “access” and really this is why the topic is so important. Broadly stated, it’s intentionally designing the world to include everyone, regardless of disability. So we have access to more of life. 

For people with disabilities who have access to the Internet, independent access to information offers an unprecedented amount of freedom. 

According to [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/), most studies find that about one fifth (20%) of the population has some kind of disability.  

Even though not all of these people have disabilities that make them difficult to access the internet, it is still a significant portion of the population. This number would increase as senior population grows as projected by [United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)](https://www.unfpa.org/publications/ageing-twenty-first-century). As they age, people could have these problems in various levels and some would have more than one problem. Remember, we are all temporarily able-bodied.

## Benefits of having an accessible website

Let's take a look at some benefits of having accessible website, and these are also reasons **why you make your website accessible**.

### 1. Improve the lives of people with disabilities

You do something positive for the world.  You promote a culture of accessibility and inclusion. Web accessibility is essential for equal opportunity.
    
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - When an organization's website is not accessible, it further excludes people with disabilities from society. When an organization's website is accessible, it empowers people with disabilities to participate in society. Providing an accessible website is one way an organization can demonstrate that it strives to meet the access needs of a diverse society.

### 2. Build positive public relations 

An organization's efforts in Web accessibility are a public relations opportunity to increase its positive image, which can increase website use.
  
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been shown to improve financial performance, enhance brand image and reputation, increase sales and customer loyalty, increase ability to attract and retain employees, and provide access to capital and funding. Additional perspectives on CSR, such as statistics that show how CSR impacts customers, are available on the Web.

### 3. Broaden your market penetration

You expand your customer/audience base. According to a [2010 report from the U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2012/demo/p70-131.pdf), around 18.7% of the U.S. population lives with a disability and, out of that number, 12.6% have a severe disability.  

A [study in the United Kingdom (UK)](https://disability-smart.com/2017/01/10/is-there-really-a-business-case-for-website-accessibility/) found that 71% of web users with a disability will simply leave a website that is not accessible. 

    
### 4. Avoid discrimination and legal complications

Your website will comply with your country’s equality and anti-discrimination law.
  
Internationally, governments, but also private companies and organisations, are becoming subject to legal challenges because of their inaccessible online content and service offerings.

In the US, public sector entities (government-funded programs/schools, airlines, and nonprofits) are required to follow certain website accessibility rules, while private sector companies just [hope they will not get sued](https://insight.cryptzone.com/accessibility/6-web-accessibility-takeaways-winn-dixie-accessibility-decision/).
  
In 2017 the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) passed a ruling to update the old 508 rules to be more inline with WCAG 2.0 guidelines, meaning that website accessibility updates are required for most public websites — and it is just a matter of time before private websites will be as well.

### 5. Better Search Engine Optimization (SEO)  

Accessibility techniques increase the findability of web pages by exposing content to search engines, both internally (within a website) and externally (across the World Wide Web).  Most of the search engines are only able to process text and the way it is structured.  By having a well-marked up site, they can index your site for more relevant information in search results. 


### 6. Improve usability for all types of users

Not just people with disabilities, but web accessibility also helps people who:
  
- Have a slow internet connection
  - location- for example, rural areas where high speed connections are not available or mobile phone reception is limited
  - bandwidth congestion
- Use older technologies
  - old web browser
  - operating system
- Have a small screen or unusual device
- Can't listen to audio content in where they are at the moment (ex. work, hospital, etc.)
- Are not familiar with the technologies involved to use websites
  -  infrequent Web users
  -  new to Web


### 7. Produce a high quality and highly flexible website

- Reduces site development and maintenance time and cost
- Enables content on different configurations, such as mobile devices, screen readers, different operating systems and browsers;
- ‘Future proofed’, that means being prepared for implementing future technologies;
- Cross-browser compatibility.

## What it takes to access web sites

Some components are involved to make websites availalble to any of us. First, we have infomration to put on a website. We refer it as **web content**.  Second, we need tools to create a website, which is categorized as **authoring tools**. Third, we need means to get to the webiste. That is **user agents**. Let's take a look at each component closely.

### Web content

It is any part of a web site such as:

- text
- images
- forms
- multimedia (audio, video, animation) [content requires another layer of means to access its content]
- any markup code
- scripts 
- applications

### Authoring tools

They are the tools to build a website. They can be software or services that people use to produce web content. Here are some of them:

- code editors
- document conversion tools
- content management systems
- blogs
- database scripts


### User agents
Software that people use to access web content:

- desktop graphical browsers
- voice browsers
- mobile phone browsers
- multimedia players
- plug-ins
- assistive technologies


To be able to access a website, these components need to play well together. If web content is not available, you wouldn't see anything on the website.  If authoring tools are not available, you couldn't have your information or messages on your website.  If user agents are not available, you cannot get to the website or the content on the website. Every component is equally important to make a website avaiable.

Web accessibility principles and techniques support these components to optimize their capabilities to make websites available to broad range of users.

## Obstacles to use websites

People with the following conditions find using websites challenging.

- Problems with sight:
  - blindness
  - low vision 
  - color-blindness
- Problems with hearing: 
  - deafness
  - hard-of-hearing
- Problems using a mouse or keyboard:
  - inability to use a mouse or/and a keyboard
  - slow response time
  - limited for motor control
- Problems with reading and understanding: 
  - learning disabilities
  - distractibility
  - inability to remember
  - focus on large amount of information

We can ease such problems with our [TO DO]

### Get to know people with disabilities

It is essential for us to learn disabilities and a life with them when we think how we could accomodate people with disabilities as our website users.  Disabilities are not just types of conditions. There are much more to be aware.
 
Some have disabilities at birth. 

Some got disabilities at some point of their life by illness, accidents, aging and so on. In this group, some of them suddenly faced their imparent. To the others, it could develop with various manners. 

Disability is not always permenent. Some have disabilities for certain period of time.  They could be in their recovery from injuries, illness, medical precedures and so on.

Also, there are various range of the sevirity of their imparements. Some of them could have multiple disabilities.

Most of disabilities are not visually recognizeable.  [You can learn about some types of disabilities.]()

The adoptability to their imparements also varies depending on their situations.  

You cannot assume all blind people understand/use braille or any deaf people understand/use sign languages.

### How people with disabilities use websites

TODO - FILL. This could be learn more?
Or, what happens when peopel with disabilities use in-accessible websites. --- SHOW THE PROBLEMS to guide them understand what needs to be covered.

Let's explore how people with disabilities use websites.



## What you can do to make our website accessible

There are four main principles to make our website accessible based on these basic concepts:

- Understanding the user's perspective and needs
- Moving beyond technical accessibility
- Focusing on the principles of accessibility


### PERCEIVABLE information and user interface

Starting at the most basic level, users must be able to process information.
The information could be text, audio, static image, video, and so on, things presented in your website, which are referred as **web content**. 

Information that is not presented in a processable format is not accessible. Websites and apps that require sight or hearing won't pass the test of perceivability.

#### Text alternatives for non-text content

Text alternatives convey the purpose of an image or function to provide an equivalent user experience. For examples:

- Short equivalents for images, including icons, buttons, and graphics;
- Description of data represented on charts, diagrams, and illustrations;
- Brief descriptions of non-text content such as audio and video files;
- Labels for form controls, input, and other user interface components.


#### Captions and other alternatives for multimedia

Among other affordances, this means providing text for those who cannot hear, and audio for those who cannot see. It does not mean creating audio for all text, but content must be consumable by screen readers and other assistive technologies.

#### Content can be presented in different ways

Since not everyone has the same abilities or equal use of the same senses, one of the main keys to accessibility is ensuring that information is transformable from one form into another, so that it can be perceived in multiple ways.

Organize information to have with meaning (semantic structure). Design with text and create information hierarchies. When the presentation is disabled, the web content should still be able to communicate its message effectively.

#### Content is easier to see and hear

- Color is not used as the only way of conveying information or identifying content
- Default foreground and background color combinations provide sufficient contrast
- Text is resizable up to 200% without losing information, using a standard browser
- Images of text are resizable, replaced with actual text, or avoided where possible
- Users can pause, stop, or adjust the volume of audio that is played on a website
- Background audio is low or can be turned off, to avoid interference or distraction

**Ask yourself**: Is there anything on our website that a blind, deaf, low vision, or color blind user would not be able to perceive?



### OPERABLE user interface and navigation

#### Functionality is available from a keyboard

Not everyone uses a standard keyboard and mouse to access the web. Some people use adaptive devices or alternative devices that accommodate their disabilities. Some people simply prefer to use the alternative technologies. Many users with disabilities cannot operate a mouse. Alternatives like keyboard-based operation should be implemented.

Keyboard accessibility includes:

- All functionality that is available by mouse is also available by keyboard;
- Keyboard focus does not get trapped in any part of the content;
- Web browsers, authoring tools, and other tools provide keyboard support.

#### Users have enough time to read and use the content

Some people need more time than others to read and use the content. For instance, some people require more time to type text, understand instructions, operate controls, or to otherwise complete tasks on a website.

Examples of providing enough time include providing mechanisms to:

- Stop, extend, or adjust time limits, except where necessary;
- Pause, stop, or hide moving, blinking, or scrolling content;
- Postpone or suppress interruptions, except where necessary;
- Re-authenticate when a session expires without losing data.
- Time limits for completing an action should be generous or configurable.

#### Content does not cause seizures

Content that flashes at certain rates or patterns can cause photosensitive reactions, including seizures. Flashing content is ideally avoided entirely or only used in a way that does not cause known risks.

#### Users can easily navigate, find content, and determine where they are

With web pages or sections of Web content, users should be able to bypass extraneous or irrelevant pieces of content in order to focus on the content of interest to them. They should be able discern the structure of the content by its headings, subsections, bulleted lists, and other elements of semantic markup.

Well organized content helps users to orient themselves and to navigate effectively. Such content includes:

- Pages have clear titles and are organized using descriptive section headings;
- There is more than one way to find relevant pages within a set of web pages;
Users are informed about their current location within a set of related pages;
- There are ways to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple pages;
- The keyboard focus is visible, and the focus order follows a meaningful sequence;
- The purpose of a link is evident, ideally even when the link is viewed on its own.

**Ask yourself**: Can all functions of our website be performed with a keyboard? Can users control interactive elements of our website? Does our website make completing tasks easy?




### UNDERSTANDABLE information and user interface

If users can perceive and operate a website, that doesn't mean they can understand it. Understandable websites use clear, concise language and offer functionality that is easy to comprehend. Writing should be clear and concise. 

#### Text is readable and understandable

- Identifying the primary language of a web page, such as Arabic, Dutch, or Korean;
- Identifying the language of text passages, phrases, or other parts of a web page;
- Providing definitions for any unusual words, phrases, idioms, and abbreviations;
- Using the clearest and simplest language possible, or providing simplified versions.

#### Content appears and operates in predictable ways

Many people rely on predictable user interfaces and are disoriented or distracted by inconsistent appearance or behavior. Examples of making content more predictable include:

- Navigation mechanisms that are repeated on multiple pages appear in the same place each time;
- User interface components that are repeated on web pages have the same labels each time;
- Forms should follow a logical flow and provide clear labels.
- If a user takes an action, the connection between the action and the result should be obvious. 
- Significant changes on a web page do not happen without the consent of the user.

#### Users are helped to avoid and correct mistakes

Sites and apps should be forgiving. All people, not just those with disabilities, make mistakes through forms and other interaction, which can be confusing or difficult to use. Examples of helping users to avoid and correct mistakes include:

- Descriptive instructions, warnings, error messages, and suggestions for correction;
- Context-sensitive help for more complex functionality and interaction;
- Opportunity to review, correct, reverse submissions, or canellation options if necessary.

If this feels like usability and not accessibility, that's because usable websites are inherently more accessible.

**Ask yourself**: Is all of the text on our website clearly written? Are all of the interactions easy to understand?


### ROBUST content and reliable interpretation

#### Content is compatible with current and future user tools

Users pick their own mix of technologies. Within limits, websites should work well-enough across platforms, browsers, and devices to account for personal choice and user need. 

Robust content is compatible with different browsers, assistive technologies, and other user agents.  One of the best ways to meet the principle of robustness is to follow development standards and conventions. Clean code is generally more robust and consumable across platforms.

- Ensuring markup can be reliably interpreted, for instance by ensuring it is valid;
- Providing a name, role, and value for non-standard user interface components.

**Ask yourself**: Does our website only support the newest browsers or operating systems? Is our website developed with best practices?

# Accessibility

In addition to the following items below individual components, colors and page layouts may also have additional accessibility notes. For design purposes the following at minimum must be met, though there may be other applicable guidelines.

## Accessibility Guidelines

### Standards

* WCAG 2.0
* AA

### Contrast

* For font sizes under 18 point  \(or 14 points if bold\) contrast must be a minimum of 4.5:1
* For font sizes greater than 18 points \(or 14 points if bold\) contrast must be a minimum of 3:1

### **Color**

* Color cannot be the only means of displaying information. Additional items such as a label, higher contrast or another visual cue must be used.

### Images and other Non-Text Content

* All non-text content must have a text alternative on the page that displays the same information such as
  * Alt tags or aria labels on all images \(these must describe what is happening within the image\)
    * In the event an image is purely decorative in nature the alt tag must be present but should be blank
    * Note that items such as stock photography or landscapes are not considered purely decorative and must have the appropriate descriptors
  * Transcriptions of video or closed captioning

#### Iconography

Note that iconography is a special type of image content.

* * Current guidelines display all icons with a label underneath them
  * If this guideline is followed then the alt tag should be left empty \(but it should still exist\)
  * If the label is removed then an alt tag with proper information must be applied

### **Links**

* The purpose of a link can be determined from the link text alone or or from the text combined with programmatically determined content
  * The largest errors usually found here are on article preview links or similar where there may be multiple links on a page stating “read more” or other similar repeatable text, this should be avoided.
* Additionally links that are not links but items such as files, e-mail to links and phone numbers should be clearly labeled as such

### Rich Text Editors

* These should be used sparingly across the site. Rich text editors have the potential to easily break 508c compliance as many of the programmatic fail safes that exist will not happen within a rich text editor
* If a rich text editor is used the content author needs to be sure to follow good programming guidelines if using HTML \(such as semantic markup and using appropriate labels\)
* Additional focus also needs to be taken on headings, labels and other items to guarantee an [adherence to the pages navigability](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=111%2C141%2C143&levels=aaa#navigation-mechanisms)

### Headings

* Headings should not be used to convey style items
* Headings must be hierarchical and properly nested \(all h2’s within an h1 etc\) so as to maintain proper navigability for low or non-sighted users

### **Tables**

The current tables as defined in components are accessible. However these tables must be used appropriately in-order to remain so. The following rules must be adhered too

* Only use tables for tabular data \(don’t use tables for styling purposes\)
* All labels within a table must be next to the data they are labeling \(the current examples adhere to this pattern\)

## **Accessibility Checkers**

Note that the following checkers will only catch programmatic misses such as missing alt tags or improper contrast ratios. Many accessibility errors can only be caught by humans and hence online checkers should only be one part of the confirmation process.

* [Wave](http://wave.webaim.org/)
* [Access Valet](http://valet.webthing.com/access/url.html)
* [A Checker](https://achecker.ca/checker/)

## **Additional Resources and Guidelines**

Generally speaking the rules above do not encompass the entirety of all accessibility considerations on the site and additional information may be necessary. Further resources can be found below

* [WCAG Quick Reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/)
* [Entirety of the WCAG 2.0 Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)
* [Web Aim which is an independent company with good information](http://webaim.org/)
