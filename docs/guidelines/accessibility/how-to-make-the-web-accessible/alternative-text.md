# Alternative Text

## **Non-text content needs alternative presentation**

This means providing text for those who cannot hear, and audio for those who cannot see. For non-text content such as images, movies,  and videos, screen readers need to have access to alternative text presentation in order to accurately convey this content to users. Audio content should include captions or transcripts. Sign language can also supplement information and text that is challenging to read. 

Text alternatives convey the purpose of an image or function to provide an equivalent user experience. For examples:

* Short equivalents for images, including icons, buttons, and graphics;
* Description of data represented on charts, diagrams, and illustrations;
* Brief descriptions of non-text content such as audio and video files;
* Labels for form controls, input, and other user interface components.
