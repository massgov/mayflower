# Visuals

## **Consider visual comprehension**

Some individuals have difficulties processing visual information, the opposite of the problem experienced by people with reading and verbal processing difficulties. For example, they may not realize that a photograph of a person is a representation of a person, though they can plainly see the photograph itself \(as an object\) on the web page. For these people, a moving, talking person in a video may be easier to mentally process than a static image of a person in a photograph. Video and multimedia, accompanied with narration, may be the best way to communicate to these individuals.

## **Text presented in graphics**

Some kinds of content are difficult to interpret when enlarged. For example, graphics that contain text can become blocky and pixilated, making the text difficult to understand. Text should be resizable up to 200% without losing information, using a standard browser
