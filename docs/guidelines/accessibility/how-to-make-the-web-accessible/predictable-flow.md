# Navigation

## Predictable Flow

It is important to include both visual and non-visual orientation cues, page structure, and other navigational aids. Inconsistent, unpredictable, and overly complicated navigation mechanisms and page functions provider a poor user experience for all users.

Many people rely on predictable user interfaces and are disoriented or distracted by inconsistent appearance or behavior. Examples of making content more predictable include:

* Navigation mechanisms that are repeated on multiple pages appear in the same place each time;
* User interface components that are repeated on web pages have the same labels each time;
* Forms should follow a logical flow and provide clear labels.
* If a user takes an action, the connection between the action and the result should be obvious.
* Significant changes on a web page do not happen without the consent of the user

### **Do no assume the user will remember**

Some users may have memory difficulties that impair their ability to remember how they got to content. Any kind of reminder of the overall context of a web site can help people with memory deficits.

## **Horizontal scrolling**

For users leveraging screen magnifiers, websites with horizontal scrollbars are difficult to use.
