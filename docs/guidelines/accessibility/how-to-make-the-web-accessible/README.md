# How to make the web accessible

Before we go into approaches for making an accessible website, it is important to understand the basic pieces needed for anyone to access a website.

There is the information that needs to be put on a website or, more simply, **web content**. There are tools needed to create a website. These are our **authoring tools**. Finally, there needs to be a way to get to the website, which, in technical speak is called a **user agent**. Let's take a look at each component closely.

| Component | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Web Content** | The informational content put on a website. | text, images, forms, multimedia \(audio, video, animation\), any markup code, scripts, applications |
| **Authoring Tools** | The tools to build a website. | code editors, document conversion tools, content management systems \(CMS\), blogs, database scripts |
| **User Agents** | The software people use to access web content. | desktop graphical browsers, voice browsers, mobile phone browsers, multimedia players, plug-ins , assistive technologies |

To be able to access a website, these components need to play well together. If web content is not available, you wouldn't see anything on the website. If authoring tools are not available, you couldn't have your information or messages on your website. If user agents are not available, you cannot get to the website or the content on the website. Every component is equally important to make a website available.

Web accessibility principles and techniques support these components, permitting websites to be available to broad range of users.
