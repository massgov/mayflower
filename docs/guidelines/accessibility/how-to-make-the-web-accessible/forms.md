# Forms

Some individuals have a difficult time solving problems as they arise. In many instances, their resilience can be low and the resulting frustration is such that they choose to leave the site and not persist to solve the problem. Providing instructions at the start of a task will eliminate or at least reduce the overall number of user errors. Error messages should be as explanatory as possible, telling users what they did wrong and how to fix the problem. Also, avoid extreme changes in the context of the web site without first warning users. All functionality should be as predictable as possible, and any deviations from predictability should be preceded by warnings and/or explained to users after the changes occur.

Sites and apps should be forgiving. All people, not just those with disabilities, make mistakes through forms and other interaction, which can be confusing or difficult to use. Examples of helping users to avoid and correct mistakes include:

* Descriptive instructions, warnings, error messages, and suggestions for correction;
* Context-sensitive help for more complex functionality and interaction;
* Opportunity to review, correct, reverse submissions, or cancellation options if necessary.
