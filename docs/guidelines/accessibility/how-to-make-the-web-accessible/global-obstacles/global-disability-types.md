# Disability Types

## Visual

* Blindness
* Low vision
* Color-blindness

## Auditory

* Deafness \(= Hard of hearing\)
  * Mild

    The inability to hear sounds below about 30 decibels. Speech can be difficult to understand, especially if background noises are present.

  * Moderate

    The inability to hear sounds below about 50 decibels. A hearing aid may be required.

  * Severe

    The inability to hear sounds below about 80 decibels. Hearing aids are useful in some cases, but are inadequate in others. Some individuals with severe hearing loss communicate principally through sign language; others rely on lip-reading techniques.

  * Profound

    The absence of the ability to hear, or the inability to hear sounds below about 95 decibels. Like those with severe hearing loss, some individuals with profound hearing loss communicate principally through sign language; others rely on lip-reading techniques.

## Motor

* Traumatic Injuries
  * Spinal cord injury
  * Loss or damage of limb\(s\)
* Diseases and Congenital Conditions
  * Cerebral palsy
  * Muscular dystrophy
  * Spina bifida
  * Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \(Lou Gehrig's Disease\)
  * Arthritis
  * Parkinson's disease
  * Essential tremor

### Key Concepts

* Users may not be able to use the mouse. --&gt; Make sure that all functions are available from the keyboard \(try tabbing from link to link\).
* Users may not be able to control the mouse or the keyboard well. --&gt; Make sure that your pages are error-tolerant \(e.g. ask "are you sure you want to delete this file?"\), do not create small links or moving links.            
* Users may be using voice-activated software. --&gt; Voice-activated software can replicate mouse movement, but not as efficiently as it can replicate keyboard functionality, so make sure that all functions are available from the keyboard.
* Users may become fatigued when using "puff-and-sip" or similar adaptive technologies. --&gt; Provide a method for skipping over long lists of links or other lengthy content.

## Cognitive

The concept of cognitive disabilities is extremely broad, and not always well-defined. In loose terms, a person with a cognitive disability has greater difficulty with one or more types of mental tasks than the average person.

There are at least two ways to classify cognitive disabilities: by functional disability or by clinical disability.

### Clinical diagnoses of cognitive disabilities

* Autism
* Down Syndrome
* Traumatic brain injury \(TBI\)
* Dementia

**Less severe cognitive conditions**

* Attention deficit disorder \(ADD\)
* Dyslexia \(difficulty reading\)
* Dyscalculia \(difficulty with math\)
* Learning disabilities in general

For the purposes of web accessibility, classifying cognitive disabilities by functional disability is more useful. Functional disabilities ignore the medical or behavioral causes of the disability and instead focus on the resulting abilities and challenges. Some of the main categories of functional cognitive disabilities include deficits or difficulties with:

* Memory
* Problem-solving
* Attention
* Reading, linguistic, and verbal comprehension
* Math comprehension
* Visual comprehension

## Seizure

Some people are susceptible to seizures caused by strobing, flickering, or flashing effects. This kind of seizure is sometimes referred to as a photoepileptic seizure because it is caused by pulses of light \(hence the prefix "photo"\) interacting with the eye's light-receptive neurons and the body's central nervous system.
