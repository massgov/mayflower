# Animation and Timeouts

## **Providing sufficient time to complete a task**

Some people need more time than others to read and use the content. For instance, some people require more time to type text, understand instructions, operate controls, or to otherwise complete tasks on a website. Make sure users are given enough time to complete tasks, such as to fill out online forms. 

Examples of providing enough time include providing mechanisms to:

* Stop, extend, or adjust time limits, except where necessary;
* Pause, stop, or hide moving, blinking, or scrolling content;
* Postpone or suppress interruptions, except where necessary;
* Re-authenticate when a session expires without losing data.
* Time limits for completing an action should be generous or configurable.

## Be weary of visual effects

Some people are susceptible to seizures caused by strobing, flickering, or flashing effects. Make every effort to ensure that your content does not have strobing, flickering, or flashing effects. Even if an animating or moving object does not cause a seizure, it may cause nausea or dizziness in some people. For these user avoid high contrast graphics with tight parallel lines; animated scrolling that lasts longer than perhaps 1/4 second; parallax or reverse parallax scrolling, and moving images beneath static text.

## **Consider attention limitations**

There are many individuals that have difficulty with focusing their attention to the task at hand. Distractions such as scrolling text, blinking icons and pop-up windows can make the web environment difficult or even impossible. Avoiding anything that draws a person's attention away from the main content and using good design, such as color, white space, and simple presentation can help users focus on important content and functionality.
