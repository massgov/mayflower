# Accessibility

## Web accessibility and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

All government digital products in the U.S. need to be accessible. Accessibility means making sure your website is available to as many people as possible. It also means your site needs to conform to [Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act](http://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/sec504.htm), [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies) and the [Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\)](https://www.ada.gov/).

To make sure that your Commonwealth of Massachusetts website meets these requirements, weâ€™ve developed Mayflower, a design system that meets [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.0 and 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). Using Mayflower correctly will ensure that a broad range of users can access your website. WCAG is the gold standard of web accessibility and as such, has been incorporated into Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and is followed by most government agencies - including us!

### Staying up to date

As technology evolves, some methods of meeting accessibility guidelines become obsolete. Overtime Mayflower will be updated to address these changes through periodic accessibility testing.

Here, you'll find resources for web accessibility from basic concepts to technical approaches.
