# Mayflower Design System

## Overview

The goals of Mayflower are:

* To create a consistent, inclusive user experience and look and feel across the Commonwealth’s discrete and diverse digital ecosystem for the constituents.
* To allow Commonwealth agencies to efficiently design and build accessible, mobile-friendly and consistent web products using Mayflower as a unified design system.

## Implementations

[Massachusetts Digital Service](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/digital-services) has implemented Mayflower for the following projects. Use the table below to browse the projects, learn more about their technology stack, and get ideas for your Mayflower implementation.

#### Submit your project

If you’ve been using Mayflower to make changes to your application and want to share your work with others and/or ask the Massachusetts Digital Service team for design and implementation feedback, submit your project by [opening an issue](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/issues/new?assignees=&labels=doc&template=add-a-mayflower-project.md&title=) with the following information: 


* A link to the application
* Your name or alias and contact URL or email address
* The implementation’s target language and/or framework
* The code repository if it is in Github or equivalent (if public)
* What type of Mayflower implementation you are using
* What Mayflower Design System version you are using 
* Any useful caveats or other notes


We've looked around and have found [6 community projects](community-projects.md) that have used Mayflower inspiration for the design elements.
