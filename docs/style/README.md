## Visual Direction

The visual direction on Mass.gov and related sites should be appealing and friendly, with an elegant simplicity. Don’t get fancy. Emphasize clarity above all else. Government sites exist to convey complex information to people who are often feeling anxious or hurried, or simply would rather be doing other things with their time than reading government websites. Our job is to get them what they need as quickly and effectively as possible, and to design a visual framework that for the most part just stays out of their way.
