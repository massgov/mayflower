# Select Box

## Overview

Select box is a common form component used when only a single option should be selected from a list of possibilities. The select box should be used if you are constrained by space or if you have more than 3 and less than 10 selectable options. A group of radio buttons is preferred if you are able to show all available options to users. If you have a large number of selectable options, users should be able provided with typeahead functionality \(see input text typeahead\).

#### Disclaimer

Select boxes should not be used if possible. The behavior of select boxes varies across devices and they are not intuitive to non-technical users. Better options with comparable functionality are text inputs or a group of radio buttons.
