## Overview

The Mayflower brand banner is a thin banner attached to the top of all pages of a site for branding and assurance purposes. It contains:
- An optional state seal
- The text: An official website of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

## Variations
### Brand Banner Without the State Seal

In cases where the state seal is being used as the site logo in the Header component, omit the state seal in the brand banner to avoid repetition.
