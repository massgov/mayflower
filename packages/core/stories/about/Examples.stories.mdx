## Explore the possibilities

Here are a few examples of how you can use Mayflower for your projects.

### **1.** Write only HTML, Use our [CDN](https://unpkg.com/browse/@massds/mayflower@10.4.1) for the rest

The simplest way to start using Mayflower is just to copy and paste one of our templates and start building a static site in HTML. The templates link directly to our [CDN](https://unpkg.com/browse/@massds/mayflower@10.4.1) for all of the CSS, Javascript, and images you need for any component.  If you are creating a small targeted site, a project with a limited shelf-life, or a proof-of-concept this is the way to go.

### **2.** Use our [NPM Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@massds/mayflower) and Customize

A small step up is to do something similar in scope to the first option, but instead of using the [CDN](https://unpkg.com/browse/@massds/mayflower@10.4.1), pull Mayflower directly into your workflow as a dependency. You do this by adding Mayflower to your repo using [NMP](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager). This way you can use the uncompiled code—[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) variables and mixins for example—right in your development workflow.

### **3.** Use our [React](https://www.reactjs.com) Package to Build a Web App (Experimental)

A third—more complex—option is to use the [Mayflower React](https://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/react) package. This package is also included in the [Mayflower NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@massds/mayflower). All of the component in Mayflower core are in the React package, plus a few more you will find useful for app development.

### **4.** Extend Mayflower for a Different Framework

Maybe you want to build an app but you don’t want to use React. We’d be thrilled if you wanted to build on top of our static markup and styles and contribute a new package in [Angular](https://www.angularjs.org), [Vue](https://vuejs.org), [Ember](https://www.emberjs.org), or whatever framework you prefer.

```
// Packagess in the Mayflower git repo
mayflower
 └── packages
		├── assets		// All CSS, static HTML, images, icons, and fonts
		├── core		// Mayflower documentation built with Storybook (what you're looking at)
		├── patternlab	// Mayflower components built with twig templates
		├── react		// Mayflower components built with jsx
		└── site		// Mayflower demo site using Gatsby.js static site generator
```

You can also use the Mayflower [CDN](https://unpkg.com/browse/@massds/mayflower@10.4.1) to inject styles into third party web applications that accept custom CSS as we have done with [Formstack](https://www.formstack.com/) and [MailChimp](https://www.mailchimp.com).
