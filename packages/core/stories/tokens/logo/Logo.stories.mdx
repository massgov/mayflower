# The Great Stateseal

The Great Seal should only be used for official communications and publications to convey the Commonwealth’s identity and authority across different state departments.
It should not be used for personal or private materials outside of the jurisdiction of your office, department, or agency, including in contractor, vendor, or third-party communications. By law, it cannot be used for advertising or commercial purposes.

> The Great Seal of Massachusetts is in the custody of the [Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth](http://www.sec.state.ma.us), who is the authority on how and when to use it. These draft guidelines are subject to their review and approval and will be updated as needed.

<br />

## Variations

The official colors of the Great Seal are blue and gold with a white inner background. However, the seal may also be used in the following colors: black, white and grey.


### Three-color reproduction

This is the primary color use of the Great Seal. Specific parts of the
Great Seal are in gold, over a blue shield encapsulated in a
blue circular rim, all resting on a white inner-background.

## Usage
The Great Seal should never be defaced, altered, skewed, or
modified in any way. Please note this list does not
cover all examples. If you have any
questions, please reach out to Mass Digital
or the Secretary of the Commonwealth’s
office.


### Background Colors
The Great Seal almost always appears on a white background, but
may appear on a colored background if significant contrast is
present. We recommend the following examples of seal options
for light and dark backgrounds to ensure that the seal is always
clearly visible.

### Sizing
When reproducing the state seal, it must
remain proportionate and legible relative
to its size. It should never be so small that
it is no longer distinguishable, as it will no
longer serve its main purpose of
identifying official communications from
the Commonwealth.

| Medium  | Recommended Size |
|---|---|
|**Print**   | 1 in x 1 in  |
|**Digital**  | 45px x 45px  |

Exception to the rule: The Great Seal may appear smaller than 45px
when a software application or website requires an icon of a specific
size, such as a website “favicon.”


### Spacing
The Great Seal should always have plenty
of clear and empty space around it in
order to distinguish it from the other
design elements, including other graphics,
and text.

The Great Seal should never collide or intersect with other objects.
The minimum white space that should be reserved around the
Great Seal is equal to 25% of the seal’s width , or roughly about the
size of the shield’s width within the Seal.
