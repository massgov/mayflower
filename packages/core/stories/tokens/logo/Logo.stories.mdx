The Great Seal of Massachusetts is in the custody of the [Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth](http://www.sec.state.ma.us), who is the authority on how and when to use it. These guidelines are subject to their review and approval and will be updated as needed.

According the [public records on the Massachusetts state seal](https://www.sec.state.ma.us/pre/presea/sealhis.htm):
>The great seal of the Commonwealth shall be circular in form, and shall bear upon its face a representation of the arms of the Commonwealth, with an inscription round about such representation, consisting of the words "Sigillum Reipublicae Massachusettensis";
> The arms, which form the central part of the Great Seal shall consist of a shield, whereof the field or surface is blue, and thereon an Indian dressed in his shirt and moccasins, holding in his right hand a bow, and in his left hand an arrow, point downward, all of gold; and in the upper corner above his right arm, a silver star with five points. The crest shall be a wreath of blue and gold, whereon is a right arm, bent at the elbow, and clothed and ruffled, the hand grasping a broadsword, all of gold. The motto shall be "Ense petit placidam sub libertate quietem."

## Accessibility & Best Practices

### Sizing

The state seal must remain proportionate (equal in width and height) and legible relative to its size. It should also not be very large since its use is as an identifier and not a hero image.

| Medium |  Recommended Size | Minimum size | Maximum size |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Print (in)** | 1 x 1 | 1 x 1 | 2 x 2 |
| **Digital (px)** | 45 x 45 | 45 x 45 | 200 x 200 |

<p>
	<small>
		<em>*The Great Seal may only be used at less than the minimum size for a website favicon.</em>
	</small>
</p>

### Clear space

The Great Seal should never collide or intersect with other images graphics or text. The minimum space around a standalone seal should be 25% of its width, or roughly the width of the shield in the center of the seal.
