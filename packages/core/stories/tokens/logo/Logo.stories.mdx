The Great Seal of Massachusetts is in the custody of the [Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth](http://www.sec.state.ma.us), who is the authority on how and when to use it. These draft guidelines are subject to their review and approval and will be updated as needed.

According the [public records on the Massachusetts state seal](https://www.sec.state.ma.us/pre/presea/sealhis.htm):
>The great seal of the Commonwealth shall be circular in form, and shall bear upon its face a representation of the arms of the Commonwealth, with an inscription round about such representation, consisting of the words "Sigillum Reipublicae Massachusettensis";
> The arms, which form the central part of the Great Seal shall consist of a shield, whereof the field or surface is blue, and thereon an Indian dressed in his shirt and moccasins, holding in his right hand a bow, and in his left hand an arrow, point downward, all of gold; and in the upper corner above his right arm, a silver star with five points. The crest shall be a wreath of blue and gold, whereon is a right arm, bent at the elbow, and clothed and ruffled, the hand grasping a broadsword, all of gold. The motto shall be "Ense petit placidam sub libertate quietem."

<br />

## Restrictions

The Great Seal should ***only*** be used for official communications and publications to convey the Commonwealth’s identity and authority across different state departments.
It should ***not*** be used for personal or private materials outside of the jurisdiction of your office, department, or agency, including in contractor, vendor, or third-party communications. By law, it ***cannot*** be used for advertising or commercial purposes. Contact the Public Records Division at [617-727-2832](tel:6177272832) with any questions regarding appropriate uses.

The Great Seal should ***never*** be defaced, altered, skewed, or modified in any way.  Please download the approved seal images below or request them directly from  from Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth.


<br />

## Variations

The official colors of the Great Seal are blue and gold with a white inner background. However, the seal is also approved to be used in the following colors: gray, black and white.


### Three-color reproduction

This is the primary color use of the Great Seal. Specific parts of the Great Seal are in gold, over a blue shield encapsulated in a blue circular rim, all resting on a white inner-background.

  <ColorSwatch value="#fdb827" width={20} height={20} copiable={false} inline />
  <ColorSwatch value="#ffffff" width={20} height={20} copiable={false} inline />
</div>

**Usage:** It can be used with all backgrounds.

### Single-color reproduction

Additionally, the Great Seal may also be presented in a single-color of black, white, and gray. These monochromatic options are transparent in backgrounds, and should be placed on appropriate background colors to ensure sufficient constrast for clear visibility.

#### Gray

<ColorSwatch value="#777777" width={20} height={20} copiable={false} inline />

**Usage:** It should only be used on light backgrounds with enough contrast. Mayflower Header and Footer are using the gray seal with a very light gray (plat) background.

## Usage

### Sizing
When reproducing the state seal, it must
remain proportionate and legible relative
to its size. It should never be so small that
it is no longer distinguishable, as it will no
longer serve its main purpose of
identifying official communications from
the Commonwealth.

| Medium  | Recommended Size |
|---|---|
|**Print**   | 1 in x 1 in  |
|**Digital**  | 45px x 45px  |

Exception to the rule: The Great Seal may appear smaller than 45px
when a software application or website requires an icon of a specific
size, such as a website “favicon.”


### Spacing
The Great Seal should always have plenty
of clear and empty space around it in
order to distinguish it from the other
design elements, including other graphics,
and text.

The Great Seal should never collide or intersect with other objects.
The minimum white space that should be reserved around the
Great Seal is equal to 25% of the seal’s width , or roughly about the
size of the shield’s width within the Seal.
