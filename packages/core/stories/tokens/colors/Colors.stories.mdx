# Color
We use color to establish brand consistency across all Massachusetts digital experiences, but also to convey semantic meaning—for example in warnings and alerts—as well as to differentiate categories of information.


## Brand Colors
The Mayflower brand colors were selected to meet our brand and accessibility standards. All Commonwealth agencies should use these colors—along with other brand imagery—to signal to users that they are seeing official Commonwealth content. Organizations with their own visual identities may extend this color palette with their unique brand colors, but we encourage you to make an effort to harmonize your color palette with Mayflower as much as possible.

  {
    brandColors.map((color, i) => <li key={`brandColors${i}`}><ColorSwatch {...color} variable={color.token} /></li>)
  }
</ul>

## Theme Colors
Theme colors are brand colors and their variants mapped to a color hierarchy, to define their specific roles and usage in the system. 
For examples, `$c-bay-blue`, as the **Primary Color**, is the default color for links and primary action buttons. Accompanying shades and tints can be used to create depth. It's also used in headings, titles, icons, graphics, and calls to action. `$c-berkshires-green`, as the **Alternate Primary Color**, usually does the same job as the primary color, but when the surrounding context is different, for example in a call-to-action block. `$c-duckling-ellow`, as the **Highlight Color**, is used for time sensitive information like updates and alerts. "Revolution Gray" or `$c-black`, the darkest gray on the gray scale, is primarily used as base text color.

Accompanying shades and tints can be used to create depth. In general, the lighter variants are used for outline, and the lightest variants are used as background colors. The light variants should never be used as text colors. 

### Primary Colors

**Primary Color** is the default and most often used color on a page and throughout the site.  **Examples:** Headings, titles, icons, graphics, calls to action, buttons, and backgrounds.

<ul className="sg-colors">
  {
    primaryColors.map((color, i) => <li key={`primaryColors${i}`}><ColorSwatch  {...color} /></li>)
  }
</ul>

**Primary Alt Color** is an alternative primary color. It is used to balance the theme and create more variety to the color usage on a page and throughout the site. **Examples:** Headings, titles, icons, graphics, calls to action, buttons, and backgrounds.

<ul className="sg-colors">
  {
    primaryAltColors.map((color, i) => <li key={`primaryAltColors${i}`}><ColorSwatch  {...color} /></li>)
  }
</ul>

### Highlight Colors
The purpose of the highlight colors are to to draw attention to key sections or information that usually is time sensitive. **Examples:** Updates, time changes, alerts. When being used as background colors, always pair with the dark text color `$c-black`.

<ul className="sg-colors">
  {
    highLightColors.map((color, i) => <li key={`highLightColors${i}`}><ColorSwatch {...color} /></li>)
  }
</ul>

### Gray Scale

A range of neutral grays for text and backgrounds.

<ul className="sg-colors">
  {
    grayScaleColors.map((color, i) => <li key={`grayScaleColors${i}`}><ColorSwatch {...color} /></li>)
  }
</ul>

## Semantic Colors

These colors add specific meanings bassed on UI conventions*. Red connotes "stop", "warning", or "danger"; green connotes "go", or "success". For accessibility avoid using color alone to convey meaning, semantic colors should augment text and images.

Some brand colors like `$c-duckling-ellow` and `$c-berkshires-green` are doing double duty as semantic colors while others like `$c-bay-blue` and `$c-independence-cranberry` are not. We wanted to keep our palette compact, but be careful not to use `$c-bay-blue` as a focus color or `$c-independence-cranberry` as a warning color.

<ul className="sg-colors">
  {
    utilityColors.map((color, i) => <li key={`utilityColors${i}`}><ColorSwatch {...color} /></li>)
  }
</ul>

## Tints and Shades

These are generated as an extension of the Mayflower color palette for places where added color differentiation is needed, for example in charts. They use the functions `tint`, which adds white, and `shade` which adds black, at 10% intervals. If a new color is added to the color system, the tints and shades are generated following the same method.

### Tints

A `tint` takes a `$color` and mixes it with white. A 0% `tint` is the original `$color` and 100% is white. The range of tints shown are 10% to 90%.

<React.Fragment>
  {
    brandColors.map(({ token, name }, i) => {
      const props = {
        token: token.match(/\$(.*)/)[1],
        name,
        effect: 'tint'
      };
      return(
        // eslint-disable-next-line react/no-array-index-key
        <GradientSpectrum {...props} key={`spectrum_${token}${i}`} />
      );
    })
  }
</React.Fragment>

### Shades

A `shade` takes a `$color` and mixes it with black. A 0% `shade` is the original `$color` and 100% is black. Since shades above 50% are hard to distinguish and less useful, the range of shades are 10% to 50%.

<React.Fragment>
  {
    brandColors.map(({ token, name }, i) => {
      const props = {
        token: token.match(/\$(.*)/)[1],
        name,
        effect: 'shade'
      };
      return(
        // eslint-disable-next-line react/no-array-index-key
        <GradientSpectrum {...props} key={`spectrum_${token}${i}`} />
      );
    })
  }
</React.Fragment>
