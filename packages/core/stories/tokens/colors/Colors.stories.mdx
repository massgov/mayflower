# Colors
Color is a key component of a brand. A well defined suite of colors can effeciently convey the brand and empower visual consistency. Apply colors systemematically across can help users set expections of the meaning and hierarchies of the perceived information.


## Brand Colors
Mayflower brand colors are carefully selected to meet the brand pillars and adhere to specific accessibility standards.
We encourage that all Commonwealth agencies use the same
suite of colors in order to cement a cohesive image of the Commonwealth
brand on all public-facing assets and documents.
Organizations that have their own visual identity are invited to extend this color palette with additional colors that reflect their unique brand in conjunction with the shared Commonwealth identity.

<ul className="sg-colors">
  {
    themeColors.map((color, i) => <ColorSwatch key={`themeColors${i}`} {...color} variable={color.token} />)
  }
</ul>

## Theme Colors
Theme colors are putting brand colors and their variants into use, and assigning them roles and contextual meaning. Think of theme colors as slots for color tokens to systematize color usage.

### Primary Colors

**Primary Color** is the default and most often used color on a page and throughout the site. Accompanying
shades and tints can be used to create depth.

**Examples:** Headings, titles, icons, graphics, calls to action, buttons,
and backgrounds.

<ul className="sg-colors">
  {
    primaryColors.map((color, i) => <ColorSwatch key={`primaryColors${i}`} {...color} />)
  }
</ul>

**Primary Alt Color** is an alternative primary color.
It is used to balance the theme and create more variety to the color usage on a page and throughout the site.
Examples: Headings, titles, icons, graphics, calls to action,
buttons, and backgrounds.

<ul className="sg-colors">
  {
    primaryAltColors.map((color, i) => <ColorSwatch key={`primaryAltColors${i}`} {...color} />)
  }
</ul>

### highLight Colors
The purpose of the highlight colors are to to draw attention to key sections or
information that usually is time sensitive.

**Examples:** Updates, time changes, alerts.

<ul className="sg-colors">
  {
    highLightColors.map((color, i) => <ColorSwatch key={`highLightColors${i}`} {...color} />)
  }
</ul>

### Gray Scale Colors
A set of neutral color used to complement and balance primary and secondary colors. It is the base color for all text on both print and digital materials for Mass.gov.

**Examples:** Body text, icons, and backgrounds.

<ul className="sg-colors">
  {
    grayScaleColors.map((color, i) => <ColorSwatch key={`grayScaleColors${i}`} {...color} />)
  }
</ul>

### Utility Colors
Colors that are to convey a specific meaning or serve a particular purpose.

<ul className="sg-colors">
  {
    utilityColors.map((color, i) => <ColorSwatch key={`utilityColors${i}`} {...color} />)
  }
</ul>

## Color Gradients

Gradients are programmatically generated as an extension of the Mayflower color palette in order to meet the needs of data visualization.

The "Light" and "Dark" spectrums are programmatically generated using functions `tint` and `shade` and a 10% percentage intervals for evenness and consistency. If a new color is added to the color system, the gradients can be generated following the same method.

### Light Gradients

`tint` takes in a `$color` and mixes it with color white. It also takes in a percentage to define the percentage of `$color` in the mix.
- 0% is the original `$color` and 100% is the color white.
- Light Gradient Variants include 10%-90% with a 10% interval.

<React.Fragment>
  {
    themeColors.map(({ token, name }, i) => {
      const props = {
        token: token.match(/\$(.*)/)[1],
        name,
        effect: 'tint'
      };
      return(
        // eslint-disable-next-line react/no-array-index-key
        <GradientSpectrum {...props} key={`spectrum_${token}${i}`} />
      );
    })
  }
</React.Fragment>



### Dark Gradients

`shade` takes in a `$color` and mixes it with color black. It also takes in a percentage to define the percentage of `$color` in the mix.
- 0% is the original `$color` and 100% is the color black.
- Dark Gradient Variants include 10%-50% with a 10% interval.

<React.Fragment>
  {
    themeColors.map(({ token, name }, i) => {
      const props = {
        token: token.match(/\$(.*)/)[1],
        name,
        effect: 'shade'
      };
      return(
        // eslint-disable-next-line react/no-array-index-key
        <GradientSpectrum {...props} key={`spectrum_${token}${i}`} />
      );
    })
  }
</React.Fragment>
