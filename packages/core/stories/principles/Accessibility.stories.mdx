# Accessibility

## Web accessibility and the Commonwealth

The [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/) mandates that government digital products meet [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 and 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). Mayflower was designed and developed to meet that standard and in most cases simply using the Mayflower components should make your website or app accessible to broad range of users.

There will, however be cases where Mayflower out-of-the-box will not cover all accessibility issues, we've outlined those below so you can understand what you get for free and what you need to do yoursself.

### Colors and contrast

**Mayflower provides:**
- A color palette optimized for all forms of color blindness
- A variety of tints and shades to choose from
- Default styles on all elements that already meet WCAG AAA contrast standards

**How to use it:**
- If you combine colors from our palette in ways that deviate from component defaults:
	- Check your UI with a [contrast checker](link).
	- Check your UI for all types of [color blindness](https://accessgarage.wordpress.com/2013/02/09/458/)

### Typography

**Mayflower provides:**
- The highly legible and versatile `Noto Sans` font
- Glyphs that are friendly to readers with learning disabilities such as dyslexia
- A broad range of weights
- Default font sizes, weights, and spacing optimized for legibility on all devices

**How to use it:**
- If you deviate from Mayflower defaults apply the following rules:
	- **Never** use weights of `Noto Sans` below `350` at sizes below `1rem`
	- **Never** use tints or shades as your font color

### Iconography

**Mayflower provides:**
- A sset of icons that are bold, simple and broadly understood
- SVG (scalable vector graphics) format so that icons remain crisp when a user increases their text size
- CSS control over icons so that their color will change when higher contrast is enabled
- Sane default alt attributes on all icons

**How to use it:**
- Choose the icon matches the meaning of the task
- **Never** use an icon alone without text
- **Always** provide an alt attribute on icons

### Language

### tables

* Only use tables for tabular data \(donâ€™t use tables for styling purposes\)
* All labels within a table must be next to the data they are labeling \(the current examples adhere to this pattern\)
