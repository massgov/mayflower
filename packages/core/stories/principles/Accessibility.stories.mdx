# Accessibility

## Web accessibility and the Commonwealth

The [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/) mandates that government digital products meet [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 and 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). Mayflower was designed and developed to meet that standard and in most cases simply using the Mayflower components should make your website or app accessible to broad range of users.

There will, however be cases where Mayflower out-of-the-box will not cover all accessibility issues, we've outlined those below so you can understand what you get for free and what you need to do yoursself.

---

### Aria Roles

**Mayflower provides:**
- Aria roles where appropriate
- Sane defaults for each element

**In use:**
- You may need to change Aria roles based on your use case

---

### Structure and layout

**Mayflower provides:**
- Semantic components like article, section, aside, to build layouts that are readable by assistive technologies.

**In use:**
- Nest elements properly, eg. a section should be inside an article etc. [Link to guidelines](link)

---

### Colors and contrast

**Mayflower provides:**
- A color palette optimized for all forms of color blindness
- A variety of tints and shades to choose from
- Default styles on all elements that already meet WCAG AAA contrast standards

**In use:**
- If you combine colors from our palette in ways that deviate from component defaults:
	- Check your UI with a [contrast checker](link).
	- Check your UI for all types of [color blindness](https://accessgarage.wordpress.com/2013/02/09/458/)

### Typography

**Mayflower provides:**
- The highly legible and versatile `Noto Sans` font
- Glyphs that are friendly to readers with learning disabilities such as dyslexia
- A broad range of weights
- Default font sizes, weights, and spacing optimized for legibility on all devices

**In use:**
- If you deviate from Mayflower defaults apply the following rules:
	- **Never** use weights of `Noto Sans` below `350` at sizes below `1rem`
	- **Never** use tints or shades as a font color

---

### Iconography

**Mayflower provides:**
- A set of icons that are bold, simple and broadly understood
- SVG (scalable vector graphics) format so that icons remain crisp when a user increases their text size
- CSS control over icons so that their color will change when higher contrast is enabled
- Sane default alt attributes on all icons

**In use:**
- Choose the icon matches the meaning of the task
- **Never** use an icon alone without text
- **Always** provide an alt attribute on icons

---

### Images

**Mayflower provides:**
- The Image component which adds the `alt` attribute
- The `ma_image` class that styles images and makes them responsive

**In use:**
- **Always** add an `alt` description to an image unless it is purely decorative, in which case add `role="aria-hidden"`.
- **Never** Make an image the only source of information, for example in an infographic.
- In general if an image includes text of any kind, *all* of the text should be available in the `alt` sdescription or elsewhere on the page.

### Language

**Mayflower provides:**
- Plain-language names and descriptions

**In use:**
- Don't change menu link names provided by Mayflower that already link to other places on mass.gov
- Follow the established conventions of mass.gov when creating new links. For example, action links are invitations "Sign up for our newsletter", not destinations "Newsletter sign-up page."
- Follow the Plain Language guidelines on PlainLanguage.gov
