## Why web accessibility matters

At its core, the Web is about people being able to find and access information. Increasingly, access to online information is essential to our daily lives.  Benefits from the Web are supposed to be avaiable to anybody. There shouldn't be any exception to any of us.

When it’s broken down, the word accessibility is the “ability” to “access” and really this is why the topic is so important. Broadly stated, it’s intentionally designing the world to include everyone, regardless of disability. So we have access to more of life. For people with disabilities who have access to the Internet, independent access to information offers an unprecedented amount of freedom.

According to [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/), most studies find that about one fifth (20%) of the population has some kind of disability. Even though not all of these people have disabilities that make them difficult to access the internet, it is still a significant portion of the population. This number would increase as senior population grows as projected by [United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)](https://www.unfpa.org/publications/ageing-twenty-first-century). As they age, people could have these problems in various levels and some would have more than one problem. Remember, we are all temporarily able-bodied.
