# Mayflower brand pillars

Our digital brand serves the 7 million people live in Massachusetts, and the millions more who visit or study here. Speaking to those people with a single voice that conveys our shared values requires more than just a logo and some colors, It requires defining some core ideas.

Brand pillars are how we define those critical principles. They are easy to remember and refer to, they outline a few different dimensions of how we want users to think about us. They don't cover every possible sceneario, but they provide a good starting point when we think of new ways to help constituents interact with the Commonwealth online.

Any time you launch a service or make a decision about content, tone, or imagery in an experience, start here.
