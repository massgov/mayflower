# Headings

Headings are used as the titles of each major section of a page in the interface.

<div className="sb-block reset-vspace">
  { Object.keys(headings).map((key, keyIndex) => (
      (key !== "Body text") &&
      (<Heading level={headings[key]} key={`element.key.${keyIndex}`} text={key} />)
    )
  )}
</div>

Numbered headings create a hierarchy in your pages so users can scan them easily, but they are also used by search engines and screen readers to navigate your content. The `<h1>` is most important with usually only one per page followed by `<h2>` through `<h6>` in decreasing size and importance. In mayflower—as in most design systems—headings of the same level are often styled differently based on their context. For example an `<h2>` inside `.ma__header` has a different size and font weight than an `<h2>` inside `.ma__section-links`, but within any given context the relative sizes are consistent.

### Colored Heading Variations

Should be used as a navigational heading, high up on the page. If a page heading H1 exists, should use a lower heading level than the page heading, usually as H2. Color is for styling purposes with no semantic differences.

### Component Heading Variations

Should be used to to separate content within a big section. If used under Colored Heading, should use a lower heading level than the colored heading, usually as an `<h3>` or lower. When nesting Color Headings, use colors as an indicator of the hierarchy in this order: Primary Alt > Highlight > Gray.

  <Story story={stories.headingComp} />

### List Heading Variations

Should be used as a heading of a list either full width or in a 50/50 split the main content well.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.headingSidebar} />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility Best-practices

- Headings should not be used to convey style items.
- Headings must be hierarchical and properly nested (all h2’s within an h1 etc) so as to maintain proper navigability for low or non-sighted users
