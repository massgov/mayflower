# Headings

Headings are used as the titles of each major section of a page in the interface.

<div className="sb-block reset-vspace">
  { Object.keys(headings).map((key, keyIndex) => (
      (key !== "Body text") &&
      (<Heading level={headings[key]} key={`element.key.${keyIndex}`} text={key} />)
    )
  )}
</div>

<br />

## Overview
These elements represent headings for their sections.These elements have a rank given by the number in their name. The `<h1>` element is said to have the highest rank, the `<h6>` element has the lowest rank, and two elements with the same name have equal rank.
Navigating through the `<h1>` and `<h2>` elements allows the user to understand the overall purpose of a page and how its content is structured. The `<h3>` through `<h6>` elements provide a quick understanding of the details in each section.

<br />

## Variations

<br />

### Colored Heading Variations

Should be used as a navigational heading, high up on the page. If a page heading H1 exists, should use a lower heading level than the page heading, usually as H2. Color is for styling purposes with no semantic differences.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.headingColored} />
</Canvas>

<br />

### Component Heading Variations

Should be used to to separate content within a big section. If used under Colored Heading, should use a lower heading level than the colored heading, usually as H3 or lower. When nesting Color Headings, use colors as an indicator of the hierarchy in this order: Primary Alt > Highlight > Gray.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.headingComp} />
</Canvas>

<br />

### List Heading Variations

Should be used as a heading of a list either full width or in a 50/50 split the main content well.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.headingSidebar} />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility & Best Practices
Headings should not be used to convey style items
Headings must be hierarchical and properly nested (all h2â€™s within an h1 etc) so as to maintain proper navigability for low or non-sighted users
