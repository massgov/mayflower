# Links
Links are used to embed actions or pathways to more information in a sentence or on a page.

## Variations

#### Inline Link
**Usage:** Use when you are linking just a few words of text or when you are doing inline links.

**Style:** [To-do: Regular inline links should also have underline decoration.. Look into generating the appropriate CSS]

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="link">
      <a href="#">Inline Link</a>
  </Story>
  <Story story={stories.linkCSS} />
</Canvas>

#### Decorative Link
**Usage:** Used for standalone links that require more emphasis.

**Style:**

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="link-decorative"
    parameters={{ docs: { transformSource: () => renderReactMarkup(
    <DecorativeLink text="Decorative Link"/>) } }}>
    <DecorativeLink text="Decorative Link"/>
  </Story>
  <Story story={stories.linkDecorativeCSS} />
</Canvas>


#### Callout Link
**Usage:** Call to action links that require more emphasis.

**Style:**

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="link-callout"
    parameters={{ docs: { transformSource: () => renderReactMarkup(<CalloutLink text="Callout Link"/>) } }}>
      <CalloutLink text="Callout Link"/>
  </Story>
  <Story story={stories.linkCalloutCSS} />
</Canvas>


#### Link styled as a button
**Usage:** Use when you are linking just a few words of text or when you are doing inline links. In general, we should style buttons as button and style links as links, to provide . [*For material honesty, we shouldn't encourage styling links as buttons, should use callout links instead, unless we can come up with appropriate examples*]

**Style:**

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="link-button-primary"
    parameters={{ docs: { transformSource: () => renderReactMarkup(<Button href="#" text="Button as a link" usage="" type="submit"/>) } }}>
      <Button href="#" text="Button as a link" usage="" type="submit"/>
  </Story>
  <Story
    name="link-button-secondary"
    parameters={{ docs: { transformSource: () => renderReactMarkup(<Button href="#" text="Button as a link" usage="secondary"/>) } }}>
      <Button href="#" text="Button as a link" usage="secondary"/>
  </Story>
  <Story
    name="link-button-tertiary"
    parameters={{ docs: { transformSource: () => renderReactMarkup(  <Button href="#" text="Button as a link" usage="tertiary"/>) } }}>
        <Button href="#" text="Button as a link" usage="tertiary"/>
  </Story>
  <Story story={stories.linkButtonCSS} />
</Canvas>


## Accessibility & Best Practices
The purpose of a link can be determined from the link text alone or from the text combined with programmatically determined content

* The largest errors usually found here are on article preview links or similar where there may be multiple links on a page stating “read more” or other similar repeatable text, this should be avoided.
* Additionally links that are not links but items such as files, e-mail to links and phone numbers should be clearly labeled as such.
